    For Stephan is hard to read an twisted text.
    So Nicola and Sophia created the simple encoding rules for messages which should be hidden from Stephan.
    Let's realize their algorithm.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a text. Words contain only letters, numbers only digits.
    So "2045th" is two constructions - the number 2045 and the word "th".
    Words/numbers can be separated by whitespaces and punctuation symbols <strong>!#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~</strong>.
    The text has only one line without newlines.
    You should encode and twist the text with the next rules:
</p>


<style>
    .rules li {
        margin: 3px 0 3px 20px;
        list-style: disc;
    }
    .rules li ul li{
        list-style: square;
    }

</style>
<ul class="rules">
    <li>
        Reverse each word<br> "Hello". &rArr; "olleH".
    </li>
    <li>
        Swap letter case, uppercase to lowercase and versus.<br> "AsD" &rArr; "aSd".
    </li>
    <li>
        Change each digit in numbers to the difference between 9 and the digit.<br> "140" &rArr; "859" (9-1=8, 9-4=5, 9-0=9).
    </li>
    <li>
        Replace some punctuation symbols to each other with the follow list:
        <ul>
            <li>"," &hArr; "."</li>
            <li>"!" &hArr; "?"</li>
            <li>"(" &hArr; ")"</li>
            <li>"{" &hArr; "}"</li>
            <li>"[" &hArr; "]"</li>
            <li>"&lt;" &hArr; "&gt;"</li>
            <li>"@" &hArr; "#"</li>
            <li>";" &hArr; ":"</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Truncate several consecutive whitespaces in one.<br> "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" &rArr; "&nbsp;".
    </li>

</ul>

<p>
    But one restriction. Your code should have no more than <strong>12 lines</strong> with
    no more than <strong>80 symbols</strong> in each line.
    "\t" is counted as 4 symbols.
</p>

<p>
    And the main goal and fun. In this mission yoo should get the maximum PEP8 errors.

    We will check your code with the <a href="https://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8.git">pep8 module</a>
    (<a href="https://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8/releases/tag/1.5.7">version 1.5.7</a>). So the PEP8 requirements are not too important here. Look at the module, it's more important for this mission.
    <br>
    For each error ("EXYZ") you will get 2 points, for each warning ("WXYZ") -- 1 points.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A text as a string.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The twisted text as a string.
</p>



<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
twist("Hello World!") == "OLLEh DLROw?"
twist("I`m 1st") == "i`M 8TS"
twist("How are you? 905th.") == "WOh ERA UOY! 094HT,"
twist("The code - ([{&lt;;#&gt;}])") == "EHt EDOC - )]}&gt;:@&lt;{[("
twist("EMAIL        a@b.ru") == "liame A#B,UR"
twist(";-) 0_0 @__@") == ":-( 9_9 #__#"
    </pre>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Let's look at PEP8 more careful and examine the checking module for this.
    If you will find some bugs, then you can help to improve this important library for python community.
    You can create issues or patches for pep8 library.

    <strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
